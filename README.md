# Multi-Asset Systematic Strategy & Risk Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project is a production-grade, research-driven web platform that demonstrates deep expertise in quantitative full-stack engineering for Fixed Income & Multi-Asset (FIMA) portfolios. It integrates systematic trading strategies with comprehensive risk analytics and portfolio optimization, following industry best practices. The platform is technically robust yet intuitively interactive, making complex FIMA concepts accessible. Real market data (via Bloomberg API, FRED, Yahoo Finance, etc.) combined with public datasets fuels the analytics. The entire system is open-sourced on GitHub, complete with a live web app and Jupyter notebooks for transparency and public showcase.

## Key Features and Differentiators

- **High Performance and Clarity**
- **Advanced Quantitative Models**: Multi-asset factor strategies, convex optimization engines
- **Efficient Data Pipeline**
- **Rich Interactive Front-End Visualization**
- **Containerization & Cloud Deployment**
- **Rigorous Testing & Documentation**

## Components
### 1. Strategy Engine (Multi-Asset Systematic Strategies)
- **Factor-Based Models:** Implements systematic factor investing strategies across equities (value, momentum, quality), bonds (duration, carry, credit spread), and alternatives (commodity trend, FX carry). Supports smart beta, alpha, cross-sectional, and time-series momentum strategies.
- **Portfolio Optimization & Rebalancing:** Uses convex optimization (via SciPy and CVXPY) to maximize return or minimize risk subject to constraints like leverage and weights. Portfolio rebalancing is configurable (monthly, threshold-based) ensuring adherence to risk budgets and transaction cost penalties.
- **Modularity and Extensibility:** Strategies are modular with a common interface, facilitating easy integration of new asset classes or strategy modules.

### 2. Risk Analytics & Performance Attribution
- **Fixed Income Risk Model:** Calculates detailed bond risk metrics (duration, convexity, key rate durations) for precise interest rate and credit spread risk management.
- **Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall:** Supports parametric, historical, and Monte Carlo methods to compute VaR and CVaR at multiple horizons and confidence levels.
- **Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis:** Enables users to perform scenario analysis and stress testing (e.g., market crashes, yield curve shifts), visualizing impacts clearly and interactively.
- **Performance Attribution:** Breaks down returns by asset allocation, security selection, factor exposures, and asset classes.

### 3. Data Pipeline & Real-Time Processing
- **Market Data Ingestion:** Leverages Bloomberg API, FRED, and Yahoo Finance for real-time and historical data ingestion. Ensures data quality checks and caching mechanisms.
- **Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka):** Uses Apache Kafka for real-time streaming and event-driven communication among system components.
- **High-Performance Storage:** PostgreSQL for historical structured data, Redis for fast real-time data access.
- **Real-Time Analytics Processing:** Supports real-time event-driven processing using Kafka and Redis, with batch processing orchestrated by Apache Airflow.

### 4. Front-End Interactive Dashboard
- Built with **ReactJS** and **AG Grid**.
- **Live Strategy Performance View:** Real-time portfolio NAV visualization, asset allocations, and risk metrics.
- **Custom Risk Analytics Dashboard:** Interactive exploration of risk measures (VaR, CVaR) and dynamic scenario analysis.
- **Real-Time Portfolio Adjustment Interface:** Allows sandbox-mode "what-if" portfolio adjustments with immediate visual feedback.
- **Intuitive Design and UX:** Emphasis on clarity with annotations, tooltips, and responsive design for multiple devices.

## Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker Containers:** Containerized application for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Kubernetes manifests provided for scalable, reliable deployments.
- **Workflow Scheduling with Airflow:** Apache Airflow for automated scheduling of data workflows, risk reporting, and backtesting.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** CI/CD pipelines ensure code quality, run tests, and automate deployments.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Ready for AWS (EKS, RDS, MSK) and GCP (GKE, Cloud SQL) environments, ensuring scalability and security.

## Documentation & Resources
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Thoroughly documented GitHub repository with system architecture, design decisions, and technology stack justification.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Exploratory analysis and tutorials provided through notebooks demonstrating strategy backtests and analytics.
- **Testing and Code Quality:** Robust testing suites, linting (PEP8, ESLint), and continuous integration pipelines ensure quality and maintainability.
- **Demo and Presentation:** Live demos, detailed visualizations, and accessible performance and risk analytics for comprehensive understanding.
